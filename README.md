# Project Big Data

A schoolproject made by 5 students; [Maarten Eylenbosch](https://github.com/MaartenEylenbosch), [Laura Renders](https://github.com/laurarenders), [Dylan Cluyse](https://github.com/dylancluyse), [Szymon Vertenten](https://github.com/SzymonVertenten) and [Joran Van Belle](https://github.com/JoranVanBelle)
We had to create a search engine where you can search for data from 88.120 Flemish SME's.
The information is gathered from their website and their annual report from the year 2020.

## Start the local server
To run the search engine, you need to start the server.py-file.

## Visit the search engine
After you started the server, you can surf to localhost:5000, where you can see our search engine
